Today, we celebrate the International Day of the Arabic Language in a groundbreaking way as we proudly introduce "Firnas" â€“ the first-ever Arabic programming language of its kind in the Arab world. Firnas is designed to revolutionize the coding experience for Arabic speakers. While not the inaugural language of its kind, Firnas stands out for its object-oriented approach, dynamic typing, automatic memory management, a minimalist standard library, and a syntax close to that of JavaScript.

How Firnas Works:

First, the source code is compiled into ByteCode, which is then executed on the Firnas Virtual Machine. Currently, you can now try out Firnas in your browser.

Firnas is a love letter to the Arabic language and the legacy of Abbas ibn Firnas, an Arab polymath. We look to make Firnas a considerable programming language option across all Arab nations. In the upcoming articles, we'll dive into the challenges encountered during Firnas' development, share design observations, and discuss the analyses that arise during the development of this language. Stay tuned!
