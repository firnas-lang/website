We are celebrating International Arabic Language Day in a unique way this year by announcing the release of the Arabic programming language "Firnas."
Firnas' aim is to make programming accessible by Arabic speakers.

<!--truncate-->

Firnas is not the first Arabic programming language, but it is the most distinctive. This is due to the fact that it is object-oriented, dynamically typed, and has automatic memory management as well as a standard library. It has a programming structure similar to JavaScript.

## How does the Firnas language work?

The source code is first compiled into bytecode. The bytecode is then executed on the Firnas Virtual Machine. You can now explore with Firnas in your browser via the [Firnas Playground](https://play.firnas-lang.dev).

Firnas is a love letter to the Arabic language and one of the most important and significant Arab encyclopedists, Abbas ibn Firnas. We are excited to continue developing this language and making it a viable programming option in Arab countries. In the next articles, we will go over some of the difficulties encountered while developing Firnas, as well as design considerations and the most recent studies. Stay tuned!
